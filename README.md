# CareerRoller
A Git Repo for the project Career Roller

The WIFI Vienna wants to help
people who are unsatisfied with their
job to choose a random new career
path. They require an application
which lets you define certain
parameters and then presents users
of the WebApp with a random job
and details on training for it.
